 * <p>
 * This interface describes the behavior required of an AI player for a version of Hanto. Students
 * will implement this interface in a class called &lt;version&gt;HantoPlayer that is in the
 * <b>hanto.studentx.tournament</b> package.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, for a Delta Hanto game player, the student will implement a class called
 * <code>DeltaHantoPlayer</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each implementation will have a constructor that takes two parameters:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A <code>HantoPlayerColor</code> that indicates the player's color</li>
 * <li>A boolean that, if it is true, indicates the player moves first.</li>
 * </ol>
